It has been a very heavy year for my family. 
One loss after another, the beginning of the year was filled with continuous mourning. This hazy yet tumultuous experience made me mindful, for the first time, of mortality and how fragile life can be. For the first time, albeit briefly, my fixation had been shifted away from the living. These sentiments prompted me to started working on "Rite of passage" - my ongoing observation of death and how one grows through the process of coping with the loss of a loved one.
