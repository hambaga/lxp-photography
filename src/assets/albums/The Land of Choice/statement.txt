Dak R'Mang, a ward in the province of Dak Nong, central highlands Vietnam is a very peculiar land - being home to a concentration of more than 20 ethnic minortities, all of whom migrated here during the "New Economics" wave. 
As part of a residency program, I had the opportunity to stay within a community of ethnic minority settlers, for the purpose of documenting their daily life. I embarked on this journey with a curiosity about the people's indigenous knowledge, about the choices that brought them here, and most importantly - a very personal belief that traditional values when placed in a foreign setting will give birth to very interesting phenomenon.
